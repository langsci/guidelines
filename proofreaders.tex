\chapter{Proofreaders}
Proofreaders should pay attention to spelling, grammar, style etc. A couple of points require special attention:
\begin{itemize}
 \item are all floats referenced?
 \item are all examples referenced?
 \item are the guidelines adhered to? Common oversights include using lower case section table figure in references, instead of capitalizing these words. 
 \item Spacing after punctuation and parentheses.
\end{itemize}
